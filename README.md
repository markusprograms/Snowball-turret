# Snowball turret
A simple, winter-themed game made for Christmas 2023. 
Coded in processing.js **FROM SCRATCH**. 

## How to play
Hold the launcher on the left to navigate the turret and release it to make the turret shoot snowballs. Try to get as many snowballs to the blue basket. By getting the balls into the basket, you get stars. You must get at least one star to finish a level and advance. If you get enough stars, you can be placed on the leaderboard (only top 10 scores will be accepted). Spin-off (or screenshot) for proof is required if you place 1st - 3rd. 

## Credits
 - Middleforest20 - fix of the scrollbar glitch
 - Infinite coder (me) - game, graphics and everything else

## Known bugs
 - Balls can sometimes go into walls (they're too fast and they pass the hitbox)
    - Possible solutions: 
       - Slow down the balls (not recommended)
       - Check collisions more frequently (may cause lag)
